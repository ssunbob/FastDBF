A free and open source .net library for reading/writing DBF files. Fast and easy to use. Supports writing to forward-only streams which makes it easy to write dbf files in a web server environment.

This is a fork of [Social Explorer FastDBF](https://github.com/SocialExplorer/FastDBF) 
with .NET Core and .Net Standard support
